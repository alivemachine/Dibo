## 📍 Overview

The project is an early HTML prototype that creates a canvas element for loading and rendering a visualization for a market prediction engine. It provides callbacks for when the patch is initialized and finished loading, and also disables certain mobile device features for a better user experience. The code is released under the MIT License, allowing users to freely use, modify, distribute, and sell the software.
